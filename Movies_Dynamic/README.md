# Web Dev - Dynamic Server
Dynamic Server Starter Code for Web Development Course. 
This project was to create a dynamic web page. My group created a web page that looks at movies and sorts them different ways. You can sort the movies based on the first letter they start with and can click which letter of the alphabet you want to look at. You can also look at the top movies based off how many stars they have on Fandago.
