# Web Dev - Dynamic Server
Dynamic Server Starter Code for Web Development Course. 
This project was to create a dynamic web page. My group created a web page that looks at movies and sorts them different ways. You can sort the movies based on the first letter they start with and can click which letter of the alphabet you want to look at. You can also look at the top movies based off how many stars they have on Fandago.

In our dynamic web server project, we created a platform that employed server-side rendering to showcase a curated collection of movies. The server  served static files such as CSS, JavaScript, JPEG, and PNG, while also offering dynamic routes for pages related to our movie dataset. Leveraging Node.js modules and client-side JavaScript libraries, we ensured a smooth and visually appealing user experience.

The potential for community improvement lies in the way this dynamic web server can be adapted for sustainability initiatives. For instance, by replacing the movie dataset with information related to environmental sustainability, the platform could serve as an educational hub. Dynamic pages could feature content on renewable energy, waste reduction, or eco-friendly practices, fostering awareness and encouraging positive behavioral changes. The server-side rendering capabilities would allow for efficient content delivery, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience for users interested in sustainable living. In this way, our project showcases the versatility of dynamic web servers in not only entertaining but also educating and driving positive change within the community.
