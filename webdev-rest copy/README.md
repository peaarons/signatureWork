In our web development class, we embarked on a project to create a single-page application focusing on crime in St. Paul. Our application utilizes Vue JS as a framework and integrates three essential APIs â€“ Leaflet for mapping, Nominatim for geocoding, and our own API from Project 3 for crime data. The central feature is an interactive map powered by Leaflet, accompanied by a detailed crime table. Users can dynamically filter data based on crime type, date range, and neighborhoods, providing a comprehensive view of crime incidents.

Beyond presenting data, our application aims to contribute to St. Paul's improvement by enabling users to identify crime hotspots, analyze temporal trends, and engage in community discussions. The Vue JS framework enhances development efficiency, making the application responsive and user-friendly. We've documented our team, development process, and findings on a dedicated "About the Project" page, showcasing how our project not only informs but also empowers the community to actively address safety concerns in St. Paul.
